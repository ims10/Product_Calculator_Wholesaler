# Bottle Profit Calculator - Vercel-ready Static Site

This is a small static web app (HTML/CSS/JS) that calculates selling price, total revenue,
total buy cost, profit and profit percentage for wholesale bottles.

## Files
- `index.html` - Main single-page app
- `style.css` - Styling
- `script.js` - Calculation logic (client-side, offline)
- `vercel.json` - Optional Vercel config for static deployment
- `README.md` - This file

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in.
2. Create a new project and import this repository OR
3. Drag & drop this folder (or ZIP) to Vercel's dashboard.
4. It will deploy as a static site automatically.

Alternatively, you can host the folder anywhere static files are served.

## Notes
- The app runs entirely in the browser; no backend needed.
- If you prefer a Python/Flask backend, see the alternative implementation I can provide.
